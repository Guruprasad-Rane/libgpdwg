gpdwg
=====

A python package to read [.dwg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.dwg) files.

It follows dwg file specifications from [Open Design Specification for .dwg files version 5.4.1](https://www.opendesign.com/files/guestdownloads/OpenDesign_Specification_for_.dwg_files.pdf) prepared by Open Design Alliance.

Aim
---
Main aim of the project is to understand the file structure of dwg files.

Methodology
-----------
Part of the code of the library is static while the rest of the code is dynamically generated by ```code generator/python/code-generator.py```. Static code is written in files named ``` part1.py ``` , ``` part2.py ``` , etc in ```code generator/python``` folder. Where as dynamic code is generated from the csv file in ```csv spec``` folder. By running ``` ./code\ generator/python/code-generator.py ``` a fresh code is created in src/python .
